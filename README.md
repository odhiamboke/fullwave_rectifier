# Fourier Transform Analysis of a Sinusoidal Signal

This MATLAB script performs a Fourier Transform analysis on a sinusoidal signal. It calculates the amplitude and phase spectrum of the signal, which is essential for understanding the frequency components of the signal.

## Features

- **Clear Variables**: Starts with a clean workspace by clearing all variables.
- **Signal Definition**: Defines a sinusoidal signal `g(t)` with a frequency of 60 Hz.
- **Fourier Transform**: Computes the discrete Fourier transform of the absolute value of `g(t)`.
- **Spectrum Calculation**: Calculates both the amplitude and phase spectrum of the signal.
- **Visualization**: Plots the first five harmonics of the amplitude and phase spectrum.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it in your MATLAB environment. Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your machine.

## Output

The script will display:
- The DC value of `g(t)`.
- Two subplots showing the amplitude and phase spectrum of the signal.
